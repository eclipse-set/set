# Contributing to the Eclipse Signalling Engineering Toolbox project

## Developer resources

The source code for Eclipse SET is hosted on the Github instance:

* https://github.com/eclipse-set/

The project is split into four major components:

* https://github.com/eclipse-set/set Contains the primary source code of the Eclipse Signalling Engineering Toolbox.
* https://github.com/eclipse-set/browser Contains the CEF-based browser integration for SWT used to display web components.
* https://github.com/eclipse-set/model Contains the baseline PlanPro EMF data model used by the Toolbox for loading PlanPro files. 

For detailed build instructions see [BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md](BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Reporting issues and feature requests

Please file all issues and feature requests under the main SET repository, even if it is with a specific component:

* https://github.com/eclipse-set/set/issues

## Contributing code changes

If you intend to contribute code changes, please use a GitLab Merge Request 

* https://github.com/eclipse-set/set/pulls

Before contributing significant changes, please file an issue first. This allows us to discuss the merit of the contribution before you spend time on a feature that ends up being out of scope for the project.
