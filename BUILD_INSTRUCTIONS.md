# Build instructions

Due to the multitude of technologies used by Eclipse SET, building the entirety of the Signalling Engineering Toolbox entirely from scratch is non-trivial, and rarely required. 

As a result, this document contains two sets of instructions.
First, instructions on how to work on the main SET application relying on prebuilt components (e.g. for development) and secondly instructions on how to do a full production build locally are provided. 

## Operating Systems

Eclipse SET currently supports Windows x64 for execution and either Windows x64 or Linux x64 machine for building the code.
Other operating systems or processor architectures may work, but are generally not supported.

## Prerequisites

- A Java Development Kit 21
- node.js 20
- Maven (3.9.6) 
- Eclipse IDE (2024-06)
- [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (v0.101.0+)
  - should be available in your $PATH as `hugo`
- [asciidoctor](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/)
  - should be available in your $PATH as `asciidoctor`

## Maven Settings

The SET project depends on severak modules including SET-Browser (eclipse-set/browser), SET-Model (eclipse-set/model) and others. 
These modules are available from the Github Maven repository.
To access them you need to authenticate at Github with your Github account.
Simply add the following servers config to your maven user profile.
The env.GITHUB_ACTOR and env.GITHUB_TOKEN can be replaced inline by your Github user name and personal access token or set them as system environment variable.

```
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>set-github-browser</id>
      <username>${env.GITHUB_ACTOR}</username>
      <password>${env.GITHUB_TOKEN}</password>
    </server>
    <server>
      <id>set-github</id>
      <username>${env.GITHUB_ACTOR}</username>
      <password>${env.GITHUB_TOKEN}</password>
    </server>
    <server>
      <id>set-github-model</id>
      <username>${env.GITHUB_ACTOR}</username>
      <password>${env.GITHUB_TOKEN}</password>
    </server>
    <server>
      <id>set-github-toolboxmodel</id>
      <username>${env.GITHUB_ACTOR}</username>
      <password>${env.GITHUB_TOKEN}</password>
    </server>
    <server>
      <id>set-github-build</id>
      <username>${env.GITHUB_ACTOR}</username>
      <password>${env.GITHUB_TOKEN}</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
```

## Development setup

To setup the complete development environment you can simply use the bash file _releng/eclipse/prepare_eclipse.sh_.
This will use an existing eclipse or will download it for you to the provide ECLIPSE_HOME directory.

Under Windows:

```cmd
set ECLIPSE_HOME=C:/planpro/eclipse
releng/eclipse/prepare-eclipse.sh
```

Under linux:

```bash
ECLIPSE_HOME=~/planpro/eclipse releng/eclipse/prepare-eclipse.sh
```

## Eclipse IDE Requirement Plugins

The requirement plugins can install through Eclipse IDE (Help -> Installed New Software) or bash file _releng/eclipse/install_eclipse_plugin.sh_ (Need set environment variable `ECLIPSE_HOME`).

## Development build

This is the recommended way to build and debug for development. 

1. Clone this repository or download a source archive.
2. Set environment variable `ECLIPSE_HOME`
3. Run javascript file `releng/eclipse/development_prepare.js` for complie and copy web package to Eclipse IDE directory.
4. Create a new workspace in the Eclipse IDE
5. Import projects from `java/` via File -> Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace
6. Import the Checkstyle configuration from `releng/eclipse/checkstyle.xml` via Window -> Preferences -> Checkstyle
7. Import the Java formatter configuration from `releng/eclipse/java-formatter.xml` via Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Formatter
8. Set maven setting file to the setting, which contain above server setting `Window -> Preferences -> Maven -> User Settings`
9. Set the target platform in `org.eclipse.set.releng.target` by opening the file `org.eclipse.set.releng.target.target` and click on `Set as Target Platform` or `Reload Target Platform` in the top right corner
10. Synchronize and launch the product in `org.eclipse.set.releng.set.product`
11. Adapt the working directory in the launch configuration to a local directory, which contains an unpacked copy of a full Eclipse SET build (use a recent Github Actions build of the same branch for compatibility).  

## Production build

This is the recommended way if you want a production-style build. This is also what we have implemented on the Jenkins instance.
If you want to develop SET, this is not recommended as the subcomponents are relatively stable and are easy to aquire from our download site.

1. Follow the build instructions for the [model subcomponent](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/set/model). 
3. Follow the build instructions for the [browser subcomponent](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/set/browser).
4. Adjust the target platform in `java/bundles/org.eclipse.set.releng.target/org.eclipse.set.releng.target.target` to point to your built artifacts.
5. Build web components
    1. In `web/pdf`, `web/siteplan` and `web/textviewer`:
        1. Download dependencies via `npm ci` (or `npm install` if you changed the package.json)
        2. Build via `npm run build`
        4. Copy the contents of the resulting `build`-directory to the matching Eclipse SET directory in `java/bundles/org.eclipse.set.feature/rootdir`. 
    2. In `web/about` and `web/developerhelp`: 
        1. Run `hugo` to build the info pages
        2. Copy the contents of the resulting `public`-directory to `java/bundles/org.eclipse.set.feature/rootdir/about`.
6. Build via maven: `mvn clean verify`

The SET product is now located under `java/bundles/org.eclipse.set.releng.set.product/target/products`.
