# Eclipse Signalling Engineering Toolbox
 
The main purpose of this project is the ongoing development and maintainance of
the Eclipse Signalling Engineering Toolbox (in the following simply called
toolbox). The toolbox, as aforementioned, provides means for initialization,
managing, testing, validation, visualization, documentation and merging of
instances of the object model for the railway interlocking signalling
technology. The toolbox itself is a Eclipse E4 RCP application built around
Eclipse Modelling Technologies. It relies heavily on a EMF model and associated
model based technologies, like Xtend transformations, EMF Forms and others. The
toolbox and its technology shall be available to all members and interested
parties. The goal is to have a common technology core for using the toolbox as
widely accepted standalone product as well as the possibility to use its
technology, ie. emf model, in derived custom solutions.
